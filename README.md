# Perceptron and Logistic Regression
Back to basics : Just some Jupiter notebook perceptron and Logistic Regression fun using numpy and matplotlib.

Creates and plots 2-d training data around a pre-set decision boundary.

Finds a decision boundary perfectly separating the training data.

Implementations for

1. Stochastic Perceptron
2. Batch Perceptron
3. Mini-batch Perceptron
4. Mini-batch Logistic Regression

Enjoy!
